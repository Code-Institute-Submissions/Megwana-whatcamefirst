## 1. Introduction

### Introduction & Premise 

A quiz is classed a game or even a sport for the mind. People either individually or in a team try to answer questions correctly on an array of topics. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz)

### Goals 

- New Vistitors to the site: 

For new visitors, I have the following goals depending on different factors. 
If the visitors already has a good sense of general knowledge then I want this to be a fun experience for them as a quiz game.
If the visitor does not know much about history, then I want the user to have learnt and gained knowledge after completing the quiz. 
As the user is a new visitor, I want them to find the website easy to navigate. I want them to find the rules easy to understand. In addition, I would like them to find the website visually clear to read and appealing design wise. 

- Regular Visitors to the site: 

For regular visitors, I want them to keep coming back. Therefore as time transpires, I will look to add more questions and quizes to the website. 

- All visitors:

I want all visitors to have had a fun and interactive experience whilst completing the quiz. 
I want them to find the site easy to navigate.
