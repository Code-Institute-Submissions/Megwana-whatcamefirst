## 1. Introduction

### Introduction & Premise 

A quiz is classed a game or even a sport for the mind. People either individually or in a team try to answer questions correctly on an array of topics. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz).

What Came First is a website designed for visitors to learn and test their knowledge on general history. The goal for the user is to play the quiz game and try and guess what historical event, place or person came first from the selection of options. 

The Website is responsive, this allows site visitors to interact with the platform on a variety of devices. This may range from, desktops, laptops, tablets and mobiles. 

Please see above a mockup of the website on a range of devices. 

### Goals 

- New Vistitors to the site: 

For new visitors, I have the following goals depending on different factors. 
If the visitors already has a good sense of general knowledge then I want this to be a fun experience for them as a quiz game.
If the visitor does not know much about history, then I want the user to have learnt and gained knowledge after completing the quiz. 
As the user is a new visitor, I want them to find the website easy to navigate. I want them to find the rules easy to understand. In addition, I would like them to find the website visually clear to read and appealing design wise. 

- Regular Visitors to the site: 

For regular visitors, I want them to keep coming back. Therefore as time transpires, I will look to add more questions and quizes to the website. 

- All visitors:

I want all visitors to have had a fun and interactive experience whilst completing the quiz. 
I want them to find the site easy to navigate.

## 2. User Design Experience (UX)

### Conceptualisation

The original concept for this website is based off of the board game (link referenced below):
https://www.amazon.co.uk/First-Board-Picking-Betting-Big/dp/B07VGLK2BY

The website is however, a quiz game with its prime goal to be that people may have learnt something new after participating.

Whereas the board game has a more competitive element and a betting structure.

### Wireframes

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme I wanted to have neutral elements such as black and white partnered with bright colours for 'correct' and ;incorrect' answers. In addition to this, a bright blue to be neutral between the red and green when trying to select an option. The blue also nicely connects on theme with the historic illustration of the Egyptain Pyramids in the background.

### Typography

Google Fonts: 

- The Header I wanted to be more illustrative and more of a delicate handwriting look to appear more historical. Therefore 'Dancing Script' was used.

- The main body font, I wanted to be slightly more formal and easy to read questions and options in the quiz. I felt handwriting text would prove challenging for people with reading/ visual impairments. Therefore, I selected 'Josefin Sans'.

### Imagery

- For the website background, I wanted to have an ancient background. However, I wanted this to be more fun and educational appearing rather than a real life photo. 
The cartoon image of the pyramids felt perfect for a bright background and suiting the history theme well. Pexels & Shutterstock
